This is my javascript training on admin panel.
I created a simple blog website and an admin panel to control the blog website.
My admin panel can
- log in/out with username "admin" and pw "1234"
- create, update and delete posts
- edit blog's title and tagline

Posts on the blog can only be managed through the admin panel.
